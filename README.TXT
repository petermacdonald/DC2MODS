These files were created as part of the Digital Humanities Intitiative at Hamilton College.

The code was build on Version 1.0 created 2006-11-01 by Clay Redding <cred@loc.gov> found at:
http://www.loc.gov/standards/mods/simpleDC2MODS.xsl

If all you want is a simple transformation, you might want to just use the transform mentioned above.

Since that transform was too simple for our needs, we customized it.

For example, we changed it to accommodate the OAI-PMH format generated by CONTENTdm version 5.x.
We then customized it further to accommodate more complex uses of DC that were being generated from data submitted for various Digital Humanities project around our campus.
We also hardcoded some non-changing MODS elements such as our rights information.

The Files:

oai-dc2mods.xsl = an XSLT 1.0 compatible transform that makes MODS metadata files out of OAI-PMH wrapped Dublin Core records.

oai-dc-sample.xml = just a sample file that can be used to test the use of oai-dc2mods.xsl

The "inc" directory contains XML files that contain the controlled vocabularies referenced by variables in the oai-dc2mods.xsl file itself. Some of these instructions are for local needs only. Their usefulness to you may vary. If you do not use them, you will get parser errors until you disable the individual calls to those variables.

For more detailed instructions, see the oai-dc2mods.xsl file itself. Some of the instructions there only make sense in our local context. Their usefulness to you may vary.

Development was performed in the oXygen XML editor and transformed using the Saxon 6.5.5 parser.
